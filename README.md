Lucian's dotfiles
=================
My Linux / OS X dot files.


Rationale
---------
I finally decided to take some time and set up a git repository for all the
important dot files in my home directory that make my machine "mine".
At the moment I mainly want to manage my bash and vim related files, but more
stuff will probably follow soon.
The files and scripts are MIT-licensed, so please feel free to use them whole or
parts of them in your setup.

Installation
